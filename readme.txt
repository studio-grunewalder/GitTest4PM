This is the first file

For some reason out commit messages do not show up in the Thingy Dingy

Maybe it works after actually setting up the repository, DUH!

And if you get the scrumwise message right - it will almost certainly work!

Scrumwise is very picky, but at least it keeps giving us the error message.


Same file, different Task - hehe
